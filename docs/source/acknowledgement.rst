Publications
**************
If you utilize PanCAKE for work presented in a publication (whether directly, or as a dependency to another package),
we ask that you please cite PanCAKE by including the following LaTeX/BibTex statement in the acknowledgment section of your paper:

    This research made use of PanCAKE,\footnote{http://www.jwst-pancake.org} a Python package developed by members of the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI)
    for planning coronagraphic observations with JWST.

As an alternative, the BibTeX record recommended for a given version of Astropy is available from the Python package itself:
