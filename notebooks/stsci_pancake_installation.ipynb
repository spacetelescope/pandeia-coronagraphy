    "At the moment, the publicly available version of pandeia attempts to import an astropy module which is deprecated in astropy 3 (the default version of astropy installed under python 3). Because the pandeia installer does not specify which version of astropy should be installed, if installing pandeia or pancake under python 3 you will likely end up with the wrong version of astropy.

    "\n",
    "### Conda Activation Scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda/Astroconda allows for a shell script to be run when a particular environment is activated or deactivated.
