Once pancake has been installed, try the first section again. If there are any errors during installation, please go to [the STScI JWST Helpdesk](https://stsci.service-now.com/jwst) and open an issue, being sure to mention that you are unable to install panCAKE, and providing the error that you got during installation.\n",

    "### Pancake environment\n",

    "For the first of these options, in order to set the backend within python, you should import matplotlib along with the line ``matplotlib.use('agg')`` *before* importing panCAKE. In order to use a configuration file, create a matplotlib configuration file (see [the matplotlib documentation](https://matplotlib.org/contents.html) for how to do this) and, if necessary, set an environment variable to point to the configuration file. See [the pancake environment](#Pancake-environment) section for more information on how to do this.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Conda Activation Scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda/Astroconda allows for a shell script to be run when a particular environment is activated or deactivated. The activation script should be located at ``/path/to/anaconda/envs/your_env/etc/conda/activate.d/env_vars.sh``, whilst the deactivation script should be located at ``/path/to/anaconda/envs/your_env/etc/conda/deactivate.d/env_vars.sh``.
